##Description

This is our Project for the Course 'Fuzzy Engineering'. The goal was to create a simple Web App which would use Fuzzy System Enigneering to suggest movies to watch depending on different variables.
The System uses Springboot with a Vaadin Frontend and Hibernate with a H2 Database to store the movies.

A demonstration of the running App can be found on https://fuzzy-movie-suggester.herokuapp.com/
